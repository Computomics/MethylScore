Building and Installing 
*******************************************************************************
This software package has been designed to operate in a UNIX-like environment.
It has been tested on MacOS X Snow Leopard and Linux. 

Step 0
------
  This software package requires a functioning installation of the GNU 
  Scientific Library (GSL). If you don't already have this installed, you 
  will need to download and install it from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Step 1
------
  To build the binaries, type the following, where '>' is your prompt and the
  CWD is the root of the distribution  
  
  > make all 
  
Step 2
------
  To install the binaries, type the following, where '>' is your prompt and the
  CWD is the root of the distribution
  
  > make install
  
  This will place the binaries in the bin directory under the package root.
  They can be used directly from there without any additional steps. You can
  add that directory to your PATH environment variable to avoid having to 
  specify their full paths, or you can copy the binaries to another directory
  of your choice in your PATH
